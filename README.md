# React to Angular Converter

A powerful web application that leverages AI to convert React components to Angular components with precision and elegance.

## Project info

**URL**: https://lovable.dev/projects/ebf4bf7a-27d4-429f-84aa-2f7a1760414c

## Features

- **JSX to Angular Templates**: Convert JSX syntax to Angular templates with proper binding and directives
- **State & Props Conversion**: Transform React state and props to Angular @Input(), and component properties
- **Hooks Translation**: Convert React hooks to appropriate Angular lifecycle methods
- **Intelligent Conversion**: AI-powered translation that understands the patterns of both frameworks
- **Copy & Download**: Easily copy or download your converted Angular components
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages and suggestions if conversion fails
- **Smooth Animations**: Enhanced user experience with GSAP animations and smooth scrolling

## How It Works

1. Paste your React component code into the editor
2. Click "Convert to Angular"
3. Get the equivalent Angular component with proper imports, decorators, and structure
4. Copy or download the result

The conversion is powered by OpenRouter API using GPT-3.5-turbo model, which has been trained to understand both React and Angular patterns and best practices.

## Technologies Used

- Vite
- TypeScript
- React
- shadcn-ui
- Tailwind CSS
- OpenRouter API with GPT-3.5-turbo
- GSAP for animations
- Lenis for smooth scrolling
